				<h3>New US sanctions are 'breach' of nuclear deal, Iran says</h3>

				<p>Iran on Thursday reiterated its assertion that new U.S. sanctions against the Muslim country constitute a “breach” of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and Western powers.<br>

				Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s deputy foreign minister and senior nuclear negotiator, repeated the Tehran government’s claim Thursday on the website of Iranian state television.<br>

				He warned that Iran will come up with a “smart” reaction to the sanctions approved by President Donald Trump and avoid getting “entangled in U.S. policies.”<br>

				Iran has prepared a list of 16 measures to take against the U.S. action, Araghchi said. He did not elaborate, but said the measures included steps to “improve” Iran’s armed forces.<br></p>
