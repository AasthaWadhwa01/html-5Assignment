			<div class="videotext">China has said that it has shown “utmost goodwill” over the prolonged military standoff with India in the Sikkim sector but warned that its “restraint” has a “bottom line”.<br><br>

The reaction from the Chinese defence ministry late Thursday night came a day after India’s external affairs ministry in a statement said the peace and tranquillity of the India-China boundary constitutes the important prerequisite for the smooth development of bilateral relations.<br><br>

External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj last month made clear India’s position on the over-a-month-long standoff in the Doklam area, saying both sides should first pull back their troops for any talks to take place, favouring a peaceful resolution.<br><br>

The standoff began on June 16 after Chinese troops began constructing a road near the trijunction with Bhutan, which India says was afraid of.
New Delhi fears the construction of the road would allow China to cut off India’s access to its northeastern states.<br><br>

Ren Guoqiang, a spokesperson of the Chinese defence ministry, in a statement called on the Indian side to swiftly address the situation in a proper manner to restore peace and tranquillity in the border region.<br><br>
